Optimization Ideas
- Try to optimize texture creation in any way possible (that's the main bottleneck)
- Move Pointclouds into GPU memory if possible, transferring is very slow
- Projecting Quad vertices is causing a major slowdown. Optimize that
- Don't store matrices in Drawer. Copying them is taking a lot of CPU
- Make decompress use a static buffer, maybe even a static CGContext

Bugs
- Crash due to textures (probably because deletion/creation is not really threadsafe)
	- Think of a more robust system for texture management/sharing between threads
- Garbage shows up after hiding and reenabling images
	- Solution and feature - fade out images with fadeOutAllImages, then use goToIBCSAPI to bring them back 

- Panoramas sometimes leave random images fully opaque. WTF?
- Menu can be invisible but still pressable on synths after the first
- Crashes when can't load Json file

Features/Work Items
- Get panoramas back in
- Double tap zoom


Final Pre-Release TODO:

- (DONE) Double check on memory leaks
- (DONE) Take out all Microsoft/LiveLabs symbols
- (DONE) Get rid of geeky loading messages. Think about what to replace with
- (DONE) Get rid of Photosynth Tip: Just write "No Description"
- (DONE) make menu selection dehighlight when returning to main menu
- (DONE) Get the starting image to work properly
- (DONE) basically) Handle no internet connection more robustly
- (DONE) Display an error message when content can't be fetched
- (DONE) Distinguish between zero results returned and no network connection/other error
- (DONE) Unhighlight tab bar selection when viewing user synths
- (DONE) Improve panoramas so they dont jump to images which are too similar or too turned (nearly perp to current image)
- (DONE) Wireframe quads sometimes showing up (Snow in England makes it happen when you go forward from starting image)
- (DONE) Create good 57x57 icon 
- (DONE) Make rotate screen button rotate consistently the other way
- (DONE) Thumbnail download does not resume when coming back to main menu
- Create a good 512x512 icon
- Write a help section / description of project (non-Microsoft etc...)
- Reduce maximum cache size when receive memory warning
- Orbit Mode stuff
	- (DONE) Use shared vertices for camera cones
	- Adaptively size based on scale of synth, also adaptive radius
	- (DONE) Fix focal length issue once and for all
- Render to texture for efficient pointcloud viewing while camera isn't moving
- Next coordinate system button
	- Implementation will be easy, where to get button graphic?
- Previous and Next buttons in slideshow mode
	- Again, implementation will be easy, where to get button graphic? (could use arrows)
- Button for exiting orbit mode easily (orbit mode button with X through it)
- Try to speed up rotation with panoramas

- Double tap zoom

BUGS:
- (FIXED) Synths by user fails and displays network connection error when it shouldn't (Test case: Hottie)
- (FIXED) Seems to reliably crash when opening the 10th or 11th synth. Even when all synths are basically closed immediately after opening with no browsing.
- (FIXED) After exiting a synth while in orbit mode, the next time you go into orbit mode it just snaps into place without smoothly transitioning
- (FIXED) Quads stay visible in orbit mode
- (FIXED) Panoramas happen in orbit mode (kinda cool? probably should just scrap for now, revisit later)
- Quads
	- (FIXED) sometimes remain picked after finger is removed, but don't go to image
	- cause crash related to corrupted camera matrix. Threading?
- Image URLs sometimes "", why? Haven't seen this recently, check it out.
- Projector picking seems a little broken, sometimes
- Garbage sometimes returned for a synth. How to deal with it?


Can push to V2:
- Smooth camera rotation when changing screen orientation
- Add activity monitor to SynthDetailView while fetching extra collection data
- Tooltips possibly?
- Make state persist on close
- Better download and texture prioritization in slideshow mode
- Halos
- Previous and Next button in slideshow
- Next Coord System button




Primary Coding Todo List:
	- (DONE) Add a button to exit orbit mode. People may get confused about the projector thing. Orbit mode logo with a red X should be fine
		- but try to find a better graphic
	- (DONE) Add a button to access the help screen while viewing the synth. A question mark in the style of the other buttons would be ideal
		- but try to find a better graphic
	- (DONE) Add a button to jump to the next 3D group. Unsure whether this should be placed in the normal menu or the upper left corner
		- but try to find a better graphic 
	- (DONE) Add previous and next buttons to slideshow. Reusing one of the arrow graphics should be just fine, but it would be nice to have a next and previous icon
		- but try to find a better graphic
	- (DONE) Implement button labels for new buttons
	- (DONE) Memory stuff.
		- Shrink maximum cache sizes upon receiving a memory warning. Allocation is probably slowing things down when memory is tight.	
	- (Goes along with release todo) Integrate disclaimer and help document into about view.	
		- Perhaps lazily load pointcloud?
	- Save settings when program quits and load when it starts
	- Labels come up a little too fast, would be nice to make that happen slower. Perhaps just change the fade in function to an x^2 sort of curve
		
	
Secondary Coding Todo List:
	- Implement render to texture for the poiintcloud. Spec this out first as it could be done very cleanly or very not cleanly.
	- Cap frame rate? Or at least stop the render thread after so long.

Known Bugs:
	- Crashed once while trying to load a] second synth. One of those "pointer being freed was not allocated" deals. Look for this.
	- Used to crash sometimes when rapidly picking quads. Looked like confusion accessing the projection matrix from multiplie threads.
	  Haven't seen this recently but not sure it's gone. Look for this one.
	- (FIXED) (i) button doesn't show up by default. Why is it invisible?
	- QRect stays visible sometimes, touch up seems to be at fault
	- Offscreen-rendered pointcloud isn't quite right
	

Release Todo List:
	- Finalize the blurb
	- Generate a good 512x512 graphic.

Known Bugs:


Wish List:
	- Look into Wolfgang Engel's hardcore ARM math code w/ SIMD instructions (http://code.google.com/p/vfpmathlibrary)
	
New List:
	(DONE) Make a good next button
	(DONE) Make a good previous button
	(DONE) Make a good next 3d group button	
	(DONE) Make a good arcball exit button, layer a red X over it?
	
	1. (FUCK IT) Make orbit mode adaptive
	2. (FUCK IT) Button pressing bug. How to reproduce?
	3. (FIXED) Pointcloud render-to-texture weirdness
	4. (DONE) Low power state
	5. (FIXED) Settings bundle fucked-upedness
	6. (DONEHelp menu. Design it. Give it a done button for when accessed from synth view. Link it to web page.
	7. (DONE) Activity indicator in synth detail view
	8. Remove unit tests
	9. Comment out debug stuff for shipping
	10. About page. Write it
	11. (DONE) Strip/optimize binary
	12. (DONE AND IT'S SEXY!) Smooth fading of QRects
	13. (DONE) Hide pointcloud doesn't work. Fuck it? Yes fuck it
	14. (DONE) Make "User: x" or "user: x" go to user page if it's found
		- Add a little label to explain this
	14. (FUCK IT) Save last search term on disk
	
	1. (DONE) Refresh instead of load 1000 synths for nice and synthy
	2. (DONE) 5cap # results at 200
	3. Take out unit tests
	4. Keep in inactivity timer
	
	
	
	TAKE OFF GENERATE DEBUG SYMBOLS IN DISTRIBUTION MODE
	

	
Version 2 new Features
- Get a subversion repository set up.
- Favorites + Recently viewed (probably need to add a main menu to replace the UITabBar in the current main view)
- 2D View. Smooth transition in and out. Need to formulate quads in terms of world matrix.
- Halos. Is this necessary given that I have orbit mode? Think about how the UI might work.
- Deeper zoom. Think about how to properly tessellate to make this work ok.
