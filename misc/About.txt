Note:
Though I developed iSynth mainly while I was an intern on the Photosynth team at Microsoft, it is my own personal project and not a Microsoft product.

Technical Note:
I plan on making the code available open-source some time in the near future. Check cs.brown.edu/people/gpascale/iSynth.html for updates.
