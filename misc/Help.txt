iSynth

Welcome to iSynth. Here's a quick rundown of the program and how to use it.

Menus:

When iSynth first boots up, you're presented with a list of synths that you can view. By default, you're presented with the all-time most-viewed
synths. Within the most-viewed category, use the bar at the top of the screen to select a different timeframe. Use the tab bar at the bottom of
the screen to view a different group of synths. 

- "Most Viewed" is displayed the first time you launch iSynth. Tap the gray bar near the top of the screen to adjust the timeframe.

- "Recent" will display the 30 most recently created synths.

- "Nice and Synthy" will bring up a list of synths which are, well, synthy. "Synthy" describes how well the photos meshed together when
creating the synth. In a synth that has a synthiness score near 100%, the photos will generally be very well connected and there will be a robust
pointcloud.

- "Search" allows you to search the entire universe of synths on Photosynth.com! Typing in the name of a famous landmark or a particular 
Photosynth user tends to work well.



Viewing a synth:

There are 3 "modes" to the synth viewer, "Normal mode", "Slideshow Mode" and "Orbit Mode".

- To see what any button does, press and hold it. If you hold a button down for longer than a moment, it will reveal a label
  describing its purpose and will not press. This is admittedly not the most intuitive action in the world, but screen real estate
  is at a premium on the iPhone.

- In all modes, you can access the menu by tapping the (i) button in the upper right hand corner of the screen.

- "Normal mode" is the default mode and probably the one in which you will spend most of your time while using iSynth. 
	- Use the arrow buttons to navigate left, right, up, down, in or out.
	- For finer control, drag your finger over the screen to reveal white outlines of photos you can move to. To move to a photo in this
	  way, simply lift your finger while its outline is being displayed.
	- Camera controls in normal mode rely on two finger gestures. To zoom in or out, use the familiar spread and pinch gestures found in
	  applications such as Safari. You can also rotate the camera in first-person-shooter style by holding one finger stationary and 
	  dragging the other to direct the rotation. This gesture is far easier with two hands. I find it easiest to use two thumbs.
	
- "Orbit Mode" is accessed by selecting the Saturn-looking button from the menu in normal mode. Orbit mode zooms you out and allows you to
freely rotate around the pointcloud. Additionally, the white pyramid-shape objects represent the locations where the pictures were taken from
in the scene. You can double tap on any of them to jump to the corresponding photo in normal mode. If you're finding it hard to double tap on
a camera, you can tap the button in the upper left corner (with the red X) to jump back to the photo you came from.

Orbit mode controls:
	- Use a one finger drag to rotate around the pointcloud
	- Use the two finger pinch/spread gesture to zoom in/out
	- Move two fingers in the same direction to move in a direction parallel to the screen. This will change the center point about which
	  the camera rotates
	  
- "Slideshow Mode" is accessed from the menu in normal mode via the button that looks like a movie screen.
